This small program takes basic DEXA scan variables as input along with a weight loss or gain forecast and a related percentage fat distribution for this gain or loss, and then outputs a resulting new body fat percentage. This basic calculator will be used for further DEXA variable exploration and expanded programs. Projections of this type are valuable in dietary and exercise formulations aimed at body fat considerations. This program leverages user input validation, mathematical calculations, structured program flow, and modular design to provide a basic calculator for projecting changes in body fat percentage based on DEXA scan data and weight changes. It serves as a foundational tool for further exploration and expansion in the context of dietary and exercise planning.
